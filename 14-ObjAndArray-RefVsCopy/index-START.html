      // start with strings, numbers and booleans
      // the value of age goes into the variable when it is created
      // updating age will not effect age2

      // let age = 100;
      // let age2 = age;
      // console.log({ age, age2 });
      // age = 200;
      // console.log({ age, age2 });

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      const team = players;

      // You might think we can just do something like this:

      team[3] = "Lux";
      console.log({ players, team });
      // team is a reference to players - we can't just make a copy by assigning a value
      // players: (4) ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Lux"]
      // team: (4) ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Lux"]
      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = players.slice();
      team2[3] = "Denis";

      const team3 = [].concat(players);
      team3[2] = "Amanda";

      const team4 = [...players];
      team4[1] = "Poster";

      const team5 = Array.from(players);
      team5[team5.length - 1] = "Axila";

      // console.log({ players, team, team2, team3, team4, team5 });
      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in

      // or use the new ES6 Spread

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      // const captain = person;
      // captain.number = 99;
      // captain is a reference to person...we mutate person

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });

      const captain3 = { ...person, firstname: "Popeye" };
      console.log({ person, captain2, captain3 });
      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
      // it will not copy the nested object...that is reference
      // need to deep clone
      const denis = {
        name: "Denis",
        age: 100,
        social: {
          twitter: "@drimbane",
          facebook: "N/A"
        }
      };

      console.clear();
      console.log(denis);

      const dev = Object.assign({}, denis);
      dev.name = "Den-0";

      // Poor man's deep clone:
      const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(denis));
      dev2.social.twitter = "@d-molloy";
